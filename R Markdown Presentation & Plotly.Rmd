```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Assignment

Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

## Plot

```{r plot, echo = TRUE}
data(iris)
plot_ly(x= iris$Sepal.Length, y= iris$Sepal.Width, z = iris$Species, 
type = "scatter3d", mode = "markers", color = iris$Species)
```
