## Assignment

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!ent as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r map}
my_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() 
my_map <- my_map %>% addMarkers(lat=51.220379, lng= 4.420611, popup="Best restaurant in town")
my_map
```
